# Royalties Dashboard

A Streamlit app to visualise and analyse track royalties for Symphonic Distribution artists/clients.   
Try it out here: https://royalties-dashboard.streamlit.app/

## Features

- Upload CSV royalty reports.  
- Top level filters for dates and artists.
- Filter down by track, DSP and country.  

## How To

I've included a demo report so that anyone can test it out.

1. Upload a royalt report in CSV format (currently only works with those from Symphonic Distribution).
2. Filter by date range (reporting period) and/or artists
3. Select a track from the dropdown to view results by DSP or country.
4. Watch those fractions of pennies roll on in!
